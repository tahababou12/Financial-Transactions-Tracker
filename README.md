# Java-based Financial Transactions Backend with React Native Mobile App

Objective: To create a Java-based backend for a simple financial transactions tracking app, and a React Native mobile app as the frontend. The Java backend should handle user authentication, transaction management, and account balances. The React Native app will allow users to view their transaction history and add new transactions.

## Requirements

* The backend should be built using Java, utilizing Spring Boot or another suitable framework.
* The frontend app should be built using React Native and target both Android and iOS platforms.
* The app should have a simple, clean, and responsive UI/UX design.
* Use the latest version of Java, React Native, and any necessary libraries.
* Implement proper error handling and user input validation.
* Utilize RESTful API for communication between frontend and backend.
* Leverage AWS EC2 for backend hosting and AWS S3 for storing transaction data.
* The project should be completed in 6-12 hours.

## Project Description

This sample project consists of a Java-based backend and a React Native mobile app for tracking financial transactions. The Java backend should handle user authentication, transaction management, and account balances, while the React Native app allows users to interact with the service.

## Backend Features (Java)

* User authentication (Sign up, Login, and Logout)
* Transaction management (Add, Update, and Remove transactions)
* Account balance calculations based on transactions
* API endpoints for communication with the React Native mobile app
* Integration with AWS EC2 and S3

## Frontend Features (React Native):

* User authentication (Sign up, Login, and Logout)
* Home screen with account balance and a list of transactions
* Add new transaction screen with transaction details (amount, description, date, and transaction type)
* Transaction details screen with the option to edit or delete
* User profile screen with account management options

## Deliverables:

* Java backend source code, along with any necessary libraries and dependencies
* React Native mobile app source code, along with any necessary libraries and dependencies
* Documentation on how to set up, run, and deploy the project
* Postman collection or similar for testing API endpoints
